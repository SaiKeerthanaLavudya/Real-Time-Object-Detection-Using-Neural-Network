# Real-Time Object Detection Using Neural Network

This project implements real-time object detection using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The project demonstrates the use of neural networks to identify and localize objects in images and video streams.

---

## Features

- **Real-time performance**: Optimized for speed and accuracy.
- **Wide application**: Detects multiple object classes in a single frame.
- **Scalable**: Can be adapted for custom datasets.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverages pre-trained YOLOv5 weights for faster deployment.
